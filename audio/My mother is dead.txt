My mother's dead
---------------
Appalacian Folk Tune

By Bryce Summers.


My mother has died
a couple of days ago.
I miss her very much
more than I can show
(We miss her very much
more than we can show.)

I reckon that she was
mighty proud
She got numbers
they speak so loud
(she got numbers, 
they speak so loud.)

9 thousand hundred days
of accounting work.
3 times mental skill
she had no bad quirks.

She supported me
and my family
16,000 days of gold
she help us towards
our destiny
(she helped us towards
out destiny)
