    [Refrain]
Thank the lord for the life I've lived.
Since my baby days.
It has had its ups and downs
sprinkled along the way.

I take my turn with the good times.
I take my turn with the bad times.
long as the good times
coming my way a'gain.


When I was younger
curly headed boy.
My mind developed
playing with my Grammy's toys.

Cut, Cut, snip, snip, move, move, honk, honk
turn, turn, hit, hit, smell, smell, bonk, bonk
synesthetic Interactions
were the main child attractions.


[Refrain]

Back in the grade schools
I played some edu-tools.
They fixed my vision
and Boy was that cool

Games were for learning
better than a 2 by 4
Building, breaking, burning
real things survived.

[Refrain]

Middle School occupations
Peter, wolves, and Grandfathers
Fagotti fascination
begun my bassoon inclination

[Bassoon Solo]


[Refrain]


Home work instead of Computer Games.
Depression, resignation

College should have solved all of my problems.

Working.
