Welcome to the STEM School
boy isn't it cool

You can reach your destiny
Maintain your high proclivity
Contribute to society
Maintain our great democracy

Just follow the things we say
Just follow the things we do

The rational curiosity
the joy of the discovery
The journey's productivity
The wonders of the mastery

We are getting you to next year.
Where the Meaning may become clear.
