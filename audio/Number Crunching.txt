Number Crunching
---------------
By Bryce Summers



Number Crunching
eating lunching
conforming to
what is cool

Charging daily
charging rightly
charging always
when we work

I eat my frameworks served hot
I parse my client served thin
I've lose all energy nightly
when my free-time begins.

Number Crunching
eating lunching
conforming to
what is cool

Charging daily
charging rightly
charging always
when we work

There is no time for ponderance
There is no time for a grin
As long as I am productive
My flexibility will bee quite slim.
