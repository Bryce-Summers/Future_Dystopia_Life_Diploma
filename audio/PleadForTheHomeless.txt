Plead for the Homeless
--------------
Based on a speech given on the J train while crossing the Williamsburg bridge.

Ladies and gentlemen.
I mean to let you be.
I plead for the homeless
people just like me.

We're heading for for a crises.
In democracy.
I don't have an income.
jobs runnin away from me.

Its a bad combination.
But I'm not here to beg.
impovershed and jobless
selling lollipops instead.

Homelessness is stressful
most of you don't understand
I know because I'm not stupid
please just lend a hand

what goes around comes around sometimes
on the J train blues
If you cannot give or choose not to.
please change your future views

Watch out for my brothers
sitting on the street
they may be rather edgy
when they bark their greet.

Black or White does not matter
it does not discriminate.
it affects us as equals
egalitarian state.

I am very articulate
most aren't rational as I
not to mention good looking
but all jokes aside.

Ladies and gentlemen.
I mean to let you be.
I plead for the homeless
people just like me.

[MTA Announcement]
